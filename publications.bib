abstractNote = {We present a method for establishing confidence in the decisions of an autonomous car which accounts for errors not only in control but also in perception. The key idea is that the controller generates a certificate, which is a kind its proposed action is safe. of proof that its interpretation of the scene is accurate and its proposed action is safe. Checking the certificate is faster and simpler than generating it, which allows for a monitor that comprises a much smaller trusted base than the system as a whole. Simulation experiments suggest that the approach is practical.},

abstract="We formulate numerically-robust inductive proof rules for unbounded stability and safety properties of continuous dynamical systems. These induction rules robustify standard notions of Lyapunov functions and barrier certificates so that they can tolerate small numerical errors. In this way, numerically-driven decision procedures can establish a sound and relative-complete proof system for unbounded properties of very general nonlinear systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed rules for rigorously verifying unbounded properties of various nonlinear systems, including a challenging powertrain control model.",

abstract="Interval Constraint Propagation (ICP) is a powerful method for solving general nonlinear constraints over real numbers. ICP uses interval arithmetic to prune the space of potential solutions and, when the constraint propagation fails, divides the space into smaller regions and continues recursively. The original goal is to find paving boxes of all solutions to a problem. Already when the whole domain needs to be considered, branching methods do matter much. However, recent applications of ICP in decision procedures over the reals need only a single solution. Consequently, variable ordering in branching operations becomes even more important.",
