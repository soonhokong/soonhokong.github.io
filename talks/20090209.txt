Wontae Choi and I have investigated how to apply the idea of abstract parsing
into multi-staged languages. In this talk, I'll present the progress we've made
so far. At first, I'll introduce syntax and semantics of the two-staged language
that we're using. Using this language, I'll show how we could understand both
concrete and abstract parsing within abstract interpretation framework.
