In this talk, I will introduce the basic idea and progress of my work - building
program-specific prioritizer for the alarms produced by our static analyzer,
Sparrow. Bug finders using static analysis usually produce overwhelmingly large
number of alarms. Many of them are false positives and require us to manually
inspect alarms. To assist this laborious manual inspection, Sparrow adopted
ranking system which assigns higher score for the true-likely alarms. My goal is
to specialize this ranking system for the program which has software
repository. By utilizing information buried in software repository, I think that
we can achieve better ranking system. I will show the experiments that I am
doing and some numbers from them.
