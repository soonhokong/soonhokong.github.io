Current abstract parsing framework is used to check the syntax of the generated
programs. However, it doesn't provide anything about the semantics of the
generated programs. I will present the extension of abstract parsing framework
for semantic analysis of the generated programs. The idea is to augment the
parsing stack domain so that each parse state in the parse stack has a
corresponding semantic function. When the parse stack is reduced, we construct
new semantic function from the semantic functions which belong to the consumed
parse states by reduction. I will explain this idea with illustrative examples.
