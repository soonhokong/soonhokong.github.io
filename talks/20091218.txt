Cristina, Yungbum, Prof. Wang, Prof. Yi, and I are extending our
previous invariant generation technique (VMCAI'10) to find quantified
invariants. We found a way to answer membership and equivalence
queries using a restricted template of an invariant. At present, we
are implementing the system and testing it with some examples from the
literatures. I am going to explain the current progress and problems
we have.
