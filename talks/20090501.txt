I will present abstract parsing for two-staged language. In multi-staged
programming, program generates another program. How can we make sure that the
generated program is syntactically correct? To answer this question, we design
minimal two-staged language and apply abstract parsing technique[1] in abstract
interpretation framework. Our analysis is parameterized with abstract
domain. One can choose the abstract domain as long as it satisfies the condition
we provide. We also present a concrete instance of abstract domain - abstract
parsing stack with k-cutting.
